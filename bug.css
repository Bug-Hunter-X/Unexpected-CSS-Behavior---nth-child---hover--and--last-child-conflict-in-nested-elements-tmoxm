The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:nth-child` pseudo-class does not align with the observed behavior when combined with the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `:last-child` pseudo-class within nested elements.  This may lead to unintended styling or lack of styling when hovering over elements within a nested structure. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 5px;
}

.container:hover .item:nth-child(2):last-child {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

In this example, if `.container` has two or more nested `.item` elements, only the last element should change its background color on hover. If nested `.item` elements are only 1, then nothing should happen when hovering over `.container`.

However, browsers often do not interpret this correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.
