# Unexpected CSS Behavior: :nth-child, :hover, and :last-child conflict in nested elements

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the interaction between the `:nth-child`, `:hover`, and `:last-child` pseudo-classes within nested elements.  The issue manifests as unexpected styling behavior when hovering over a parent element containing multiple nested children.

## The Problem

The core problem lies in how browsers interpret these selectors in combination, specifically when dealing with nested structures. The expected behavior might not always align with the actual rendered output.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to see the problematic CSS code.
3. Open `bug.html` (or create a simple HTML file incorporating the CSS) and observe the behavior.  Hovering over the container will likely not produce the expected outcome.

## The Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.css` addresses the issue by using a more robust approach, often involving more explicit selectors to target the desired element(s) with accuracy. 

This approach might include more specific selectors, restructuring the HTML for better selector targeting, or utilizing JavaScript to control the styling dynamically.  The optimal solution can depend on the specific context and complexity of the overall layout.
