Several approaches can resolve the inconsistent behavior. The most effective solution often depends on the specific structure and context of your HTML:

**Approach 1: More Explicit Selectors**
This approach aims to clarify exactly which element to style. Instead of relying on the combination of `:nth-child`, `:hover`, and `:last-child`, it directly targets the element in question:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 5px;
}

.container:hover > .item:last-child {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* Directly targets last child of container */
}
```

This solution uses the `>` child combinator to only target direct children of `.container`. 

**Approach 2:  JavaScript Solution (For Dynamic Scenarios)**
If the number of nested items is dynamic or unpredictable, a JavaScript solution offers greater flexibility. This approach uses JavaScript to listen for hover events and style the elements accordingly. 

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const items = container.querySelectorAll('.item');

container.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
  items[items.length - 1].style.backgroundColor = 'lightcoral';
});

container.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
  items[items.length - 1].style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';
});
```

This approach requires including the JavaScript code in your HTML file.  Remember to adjust selectors as needed to match your HTML structure.

Choose the approach that best fits your situation. For simple, static layouts, more explicit CSS selectors are usually preferable.  For dynamic scenarios or complex layouts, a JavaScript solution may be necessary.
